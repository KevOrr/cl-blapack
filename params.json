{"name":"cl-blapack","tagline":"cl-blapack is a set of common lisp bindings to blas and lapack.  ","body":"\r\nThis is an alpha release of cl-blapack, a wrapper around the Fortran\r\nBLAS and LAPACK libraries for dense linear algebra.\r\n\r\nThe software relies on org.middle-angle.foreign-numeric-vector for\r\nforeign (non-Lisp heap) storage, and CFFI.\r\n\r\nThe software generates CFFI interfaces by parsing the Fortran\r\nreference implementation of LAPACK (available at\r\nwww.netlib.org/LAPACK).  I include files blas-cffi.lisp and\r\nlapack-cffi.lisp which are the results of this parsing. If you want to\r\nregenerate your own, download LAPACK, load the\r\norg.middleangle.cl-blapack-gen system, and run\r\n\r\n(generate-blapack-interface:generate-blapack-files #p\"/path/to/LAPACK\")\r\n\r\nIn general, users should not need to do this --- the supplied\r\ninterface files should work fine.  To load the interface, load\r\norg.middleangle.cl-blapack system.\r\n\r\nTo see an example, load the org.middleangle.cl-blapack-examples\r\nsystem, and execute\r\n\r\n(blapack-examples:simple-example)\r\n\r\nThe cl-blapack library allows one to write Fortran-style code to call\r\nBLAS and LAPACK.  There is one convenience --- scalar arguments are\r\nautomatically packaged by the system into foreign-numeric-vectors of\r\nlength 1 (see blapack-cffi-types.lisp); this may possibly be a source\r\nof inefficiency if we are making frequent small calls to the libraries.\r\n\r\nNOTE: As of this writing, the code is only sure to work with SBCL.  We\r\nneed to make sure that floating-point traps are turned off.  To add\r\nsupport for another implementation, write the appropriate version of\r\nwith-blapack in cl-blapack.lisp (it's a NOOP for non-SBCL right now).\r\nThe code has been tested (the example runs) under recent SBCLs on both\r\nx86 and x86-64 machines.\r\n\r\nNOTE: We assume that BLAS/LAPACK have been compiled so that all\r\nintegers (representing indexes into arrays) are 32-bit.  This seems to\r\nbe the case currently even on 64-bit machines, but we need to monitor\r\nthis as it could change in the future.\r\n\r\nThis software is released under the modified-BSD license (no\r\nadvertising clause), see LICENSE for details.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
